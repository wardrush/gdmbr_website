# GDMBR Tracking Website
--------------------------------------------------
This [website](http://wardrush.pythonanywhere.com/) was used to track my 2022 Tour Divide along the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (GDMBR). 

It pulls data from my SPOT sat tracker and updated every 15 minutes in a MapBox pane. 

The blue line represented the inital route for the year, but was changed during the race for wildfires
